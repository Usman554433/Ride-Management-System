- Rating System: Customers can rate both drivers and vehicles on a scale of 0 to 5, influencing overall rankings and bonuses for exceptional drivers.
- Fair Calculation: Fair calculation considers various factors such as distance traveled, fuel type, driver experience, vehicle features, and customer rankings.
- Dynamic Program Execution: The program accommodates up to 15 Customers, 10 Drivers, and 20 Vehicles, providing a user-driven menu with diverse functionalities.

## Functionality Overview:
